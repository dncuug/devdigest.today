        The 4th annual international conference - .NET Summit Belarus 2020 - will be held on June 13 in Minsk.<br />
        <br />

        Among the speakers of .NET Summit Belarus 2020:<br />
        <br />

        <strong>Mark Seemann</strong> - the author of a book about Dependency Injection and numerous programming 
        articles, creator of Pluralsight courses. His report <strong>“Repeatable execution”</strong> will help answer 
        questions: how not to drown in the ocean of logs? What to log and when? How to make this decision? Together 
        we will discuss a formal method that will help us answer these questions.<br />
        <br />

        <strong>Michael Staib</strong> - Co-Founder at ChilliCream, Microsoft MVP, author of the 
        <a href="https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate">Hot Chocolate</a> project will reveal the talk 
        <strong>“Building real-time applications with Blazor and GraphQL”</strong>. Blazor and GraphQL combined will 
        revolutionize how we build rich SPA applications with pure .NET. Blazor for the first time in years gives 
        .NET developers the ability to develop applications that run in the browser. GraphQL on the other hand changed 
        how we work with data fetching. Together we will move on and build a nice real-time application with Blazor 
        and GraphQL. Let us build a truly engaging next gen application!<br />
        <br />
