        <br />
        <br /> Cloud DeveloperDays is a unique event in the IT sector. Dozens of participants from around the world will meet to listen to the best speakers from the industry during two intensive days. In the course of the conference many issues related
        to platforms, technologies, tools and practical problems encountered by people working in the cloud will be raised.
        <br />
        <br /> - Based on our experience in organizing conferences, we know how important the right choice of speakers is. We pay special attention to ensure that each of them is an authority in their field and provides as much knowledge as possible to
        other participants. During CDD our guests will be, among others Glenn Colpaert, Azure MVP, Chris Van Sluijsveld, Cloud Scientist, Geert Van Der Cruijsen Cloud Native Architect, Jiří Činčura Microsoft MVP and many others. There will also be Polish
        specialists – ensure the organizers.
        <br />
        <br /> - Cloud DeveloperDays are two very intense days, during which every participant will have the opportunity to find something for himself. After the theoretical part, we have planned, as every year, an After Party during which it will be
        possible to ask about specific issues, make contacts and exchange experience in a favorable atmosphere - they emphasize.
        <br />
